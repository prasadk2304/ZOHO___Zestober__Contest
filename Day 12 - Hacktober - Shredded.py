'''
A chef is preparing for a big culinary show. To keep his secret recipes safe, he shreds each recipe document into strips. ( marks the start of a strip, ) marks the end of a strip. Now, to ensure the recipes can be reconstructed correctly, the chef wants to verify that all strips are balanced â€” meaning every opening ( has a matching closing ) and they are properly nested.
Task
Write a program that determines whether a given recipe string is balanced.

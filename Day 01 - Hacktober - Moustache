''' 
In a lively town, a famous barber shop was known for its customers' grand moustaches. The barber's task today was simple: find the two longest moustaches among them.
Task: Write a program that finds and returns the lengths of the two largest moustaches.
'''

class Solution:
	def twoLongest(self, lengths: list[int]) -> list[int]:
 	# TODO: implement the logic to return the two largest moustache lengths pass
     	    lengths.sort(reverse = True)
     	    return lengths[:2]

if __name__ == "__main__":
	solution = Solution()
	print(solution.twoLongest([4, 1, 7, 3, 9]))	# Expected: [9, 7]
	print(solution.twoLongest([2, 2, 2]))	# Expected: [2, 2]

'''
In a thrilling stunt show, a fearless driver performs a breathtaking series of jumps. Each jump has a specific height, represented by a number in an array. To add suspense and excitement, the stunt driver decides to perform the jumps in reverse order â€” beginning with the last jump and finishing with the very first one.
Task
Write a program to reverse the array of jump heights in-place, without using any built-in reverse functions.

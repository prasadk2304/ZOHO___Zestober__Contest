'''In a quiet town, two mystical threads, s1 and s2, awaited a weaver to combine them. The artisanâ€™s task was simple yet elegant: weave the strings by alternating their characters. 
If one thread was longer, its remaining part would be added at the end.
Task - Write a program that weaves two strings together by alternating their characters. If one string is longer, append the extra characters to the end. '''

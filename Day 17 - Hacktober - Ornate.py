'''
A skilled jeweler is examining two ornate collections of gems. Some gems appear in both collections, while others remain unique. But the jeweler is very precise â€” he not only wants the common gems but also wants them listed in sorted order without duplicates.
Task
Write a program to find the unique gems that appear in both collections and return them sorted in ascending order.

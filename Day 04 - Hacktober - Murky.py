'''
In the land of Alphabeta, a magical string s held a curious mix of lowercase and uppercase letters. Among them were the murky letters â€” the lonely ones that appeared only once.
Task - Given a string s, count the number of letters that appear exactly once. Treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same. '''

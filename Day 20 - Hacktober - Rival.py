'''
Two rival chefs are preparing for a cooking contest. As they compare their ingredient lists, they notice that some ingredients are anagrams of each other â€” same letters, just in a different order. To settle their rivalry, they want to group all such ingredients together.
Task
Write a program to group all ingredients that are anagrams into separate lists.

 		    ag[key].append(word)
